# System Design Zero → Hero — with Memes & Microservices 🚀

> *A gentle journey from "Why is my app slow?" to "I just scaled a pizza delivery system to 1 billion users."*

## 🎯 What This Course Is About

This is your **complete, non-gatekept guide** to system design — the art and science of building software that doesn't cry under pressure. Whether you're acing your next FAANG interview, architecting the next unicorn, or just tired of debugging `Why is the database slow?` at 2 AM, you're in the right place.

**The Goal:** You'll learn to think like a systems engineer, not just a code monkey. We'll cover everything from "what even is DNS?" to "how does Netflix handle 100 million concurrent streams?"

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Don't memorize, understand:** Focus on WHY decisions are made
2. **Draw diagrams:** Visualize every architecture
3. **Build projects:** Theory without practice is useless
4. **Ask "What if?":** What if traffic 10x? What if DB dies?
5. **Learn from failures:** Read post-mortems (GitHub, AWS outages)
6. **Stay curious:** Technology evolves, keep learning

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (preferably Python)
- Understanding of data structures

## 🤣 Closing Thoughts

> *If you can design a pizza delivery system that scales globally, you're halfway to building Uber… or a very fast pizza empire.*

System design is part science, part art, part educated guessing. The key is understanding **why** decisions are made, not just memorizing solutions.

Remember: **The best system is one that works for your use case today, not one that handles 1 billion users… until it needs to.**

Now go forth, design systems, break things, fix them, and repeat. May your databases never crash and your caches always hit.

**Good luck! 🚀**
